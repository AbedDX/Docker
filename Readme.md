This repository documents my journey towards becoming a DevOps engineer. It contains various projects, scripts, and notes that I have accumulated over time.

As I continue on this path, I will be adding more and more content to this repository. My goal is to not only learn about DevOps, but to also share my knowledge with others who may be on a similar journey.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me. Let's work together to build a better DevOps community!

Happy learning!
